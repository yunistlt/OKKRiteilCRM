- **Rule Engine**: All new rules generated by AI must have Russian names and descriptions.
- **Semantic Analysis**: Reasoning and evidence summaries must be in Russian.
- **Architectural Policy**:
    - **Logic & Backend**: Use ONLY technical codes (slugs) for internal logic, filtering, and data comparisons.
