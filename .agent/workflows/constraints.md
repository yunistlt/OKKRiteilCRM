# Constraints and Guidelines

- **Language Policy**: Entire user interface, AI-generated explanations, reasons, and details MUST be strictly in **RUSSIAN**.
- **No English placeholders**: Avoid using English terms like "outgoing", "incoming", "pending", etc. in user-facing text or violation details.
- **Rule Engine**: All new rules generated by AI must have Russian names and descriptions.
- **Semantic Analysis**: Reasoning and evidence summaries must be in Russian.
- **Architectural Policy**:
    - **Logic & Backend**: Use ONLY technical codes (slugs) for internal logic, filtering, and data comparisons.
    - **Interface & UI**: Use ONLY human-readable Russian names for all user-facing elements.
    - **No Hardcoding**: Avoid hardcoding name strings or lists of values. All mappings and configurations must be fetched dynamically from the database (Supabase).
- **Role Awareness**: The file `AI_STAFF_ROLES.txt` is the **Source of Truth** for all AI agent roles, responsibilities, and synergies. You MUST read this file and strictly adhere to its definitions when writing or modifying logic related to AI agents.
- **Universal Sync Policy**: Ensure all data synchronization logic (RetailCRM or other sources) captures ANY updates (based on `updatedAt` or similar) to ensure 100% data integrity without waiting for status changes.
